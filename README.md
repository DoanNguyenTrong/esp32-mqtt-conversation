# Make a conversation between two ESP32 using MQTT protocol

## Introduction

I got two ESP32 from a China shop with just $10 including shipping fee to the US.
ESP32 is a very powerful computer with a dual-core XtensaÂ® 32-bit LX6 240MHz MCU, even more powerful than a super computer in 90s.
Also 448 KB of ROM and 520 KB of on-chip SRAM is abundant for embedded programs (mine are ESP32-WROOM-32D).
Embedded Wi-Fi and BlueTooth make it suitable for IoT edges.
Moreover, it has 40 pins GPIO, I2C, I2S, PWM, SDIO, SPI, UART, which enough for multiple peripherals.

Later, I will show you how to extract it full potential on a project of multiple sensors (temperature + humidity, RFID, motion, 4x4 keypad) and multiple actuators (stepper, servo, crystal lcd).
It will use FreeRTOS to performs multiple tasks in a "parallel" maner.
But in this fist try, I will use MicroPython and MQTT to make a simple conversation between two of them.

## Flash MicroPython on ESP32
First of all, you need to flash a MicroPython firmware onto your ESP32 devices.
[This link](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html#esp32-intro) is a good starting point for you to get a more in-depth.
Otherwise, you can directly download a suitable firmware [here](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/)
In my case, as I choose to use a generic + stable version (el.g., `esp32-idf3-20200902-v1.13.bin`).

Run the below commands:
```bash
# Intall esptool
pip3 install esptool

# List serial ports
ls /dev/tty.*

# Erase the flash
python3 ../human_detection_localization/code/python37_env/bin/esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART6 erase_flash
python3 ../human_detection_localization/code/python37_env/bin/esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART erase_flash
```
Here, I use a virtual environment of python3.7 but you can replace `../human_detection_localization/code/python37_env/bin/esptool.py` by the place where esptool installed.
Also, as I am using MacOS, the port name looks awkward to Windows or Linux users. But don't worry, you are good to go.


After erase the flash memory of your ESP32, you need to flash the neew firmware by using the below commands.
```bash
# Flash new firmware
python3 ../human_detection_localization/code/python37_env/bin/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART6 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-idf3-20200902-v1.13.bin
python3 ../human_detection_localization/code/python37_env/bin/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-idf3-20200902-v1.13.bin
```
After this step, you have MicroPython installed on your ESP32.
Let's enter the computer and try to run some python code.

To access to your ESP32 via UART, install picocom.
```bash
# Install picocom and access to the esp
brew install picocom

# Access your boards
picocom -b 115200 /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
picocom -b 115200 /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART6
```
Now, type in the below code and see.
```python
import os
os.listdir()
```

Press "Ctrl a + Ctrl x" to exit picocom.
# Setup MQTT broker

Next, you need to setup a MQTT broker on your local network (follow [this link](https://mosquitto.org/download/))

Then you need to config and start it.
The config files should be placed in `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/` and there is a template there.
Let's make a copy from it and modify as our need.

```bash
cp /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/ABC_mosquitto.conf
```
Then, open it on an editor like vm or nano and add the below lines
```
persistence false

# mqtt
listener 1883 192.168.0.6
protocol mqtt
```
Here, `1883` is the default port for local, low level security connection and `192.168.0.6` is the IP address of my computer.
You should modify it with yours.

Start the broker
```bash
/usr/local/sbin/mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/doan_mosquitto.conf
```

You can see how it works by open two new terminals and execute
```bash
# Terminal 1: Subscribe to "esp32/output" topic
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.0.6 -t "esp32/output"

# Terminal 2: Publish to "esp32/output"
osquitto_pub -h 192.168.0.6 -t "esp32/output" -m "on"
```
If the message "on" appears in terminal 1, you did it correctly and ready to go.



## Push python code to the ESP

You are sucessfully installed MicroPython on your ESP, let's upload the code in two folder `machine1` and `machine2` to your two ESP32.
To do this, you need to install Adafruit MicroPython Tool (ampy).

```bash
pip3 install --user adafruit-ampy
```

Then, you need to add network credentials and MQTT broker IP address in the `boot.py` and `main.py` files.

```
# boot.py
# Network credetntials
ssid = ''
password = ''

# main.py
# MQTT broker IP address
mqtt_server = '192.168.0.6'
```
Execute the below commands to upload the code

```bash
cd machine1/
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART6 --baud 115200 ls
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART6 --baud 115200 put boot.py 
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART6 --baud 115200 put main.py 
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART6 --baud 115200 put umqttsimple.py

cd ../machine2/
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 115200 ls
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 115200 put boot.py 
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 115200 put main.py 
ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 115200 put umqttsimple.py
```
Use picocom to access to the two boards, press 'EN' to restart your ESP32 and see what happens.
